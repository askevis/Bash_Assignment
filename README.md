 The goal was creating a programm in Bash shell, which receives as input a file filled with lines where

results script:
 The goal was creating a programm in Bash shell, which receives as input a file filled with lines where
each line consisted of football match data("Team1-Team2:Score1-Score2.").Based on that we had to calculate how many 
points each time managed to collect in a season,how many goals for and against each team had and the final league  
standings in descending order.
